## Game instruction && rules for "RPG"
1. Must go through village to get to Castle and get knighted.
2. Must make choices that effect the journey outcomes.
3. Must make a choice within a timed manner; countdown varies dependent on situation; choice randomly picked if no selection is made from user ex) battle encounter choice timer set to 15seconds; path/action choice. 
4. Must battle; each character has a special weapon that carries different endings if choice is made to find special weapon along journey (easter egg/NOT NEEDED not win game). *Solo game mode only*
5. Game runs until in castle and knighted by Queen; solo mode will have user meet all other characters outside of character list whether to battle or recruit as an ally. 
6. IF 2 player mode is selected with user, have screen "split" where both sides make a choice within a longer time limit than solo time limits for choices. 
7. IF 2 player mode is selected with computer, just add functionality for computer to randomly make a choice in two cases: 1) when user makes a choice; 2) if user fails to make a choice and it randomizes choice for user. 
8. Game over when die in battle, or did not get knighted. 
9. If 2 player game mode selected, the users cannot be the same character. Example, if user 1 picks Archer, user 2 is left with remaining 3 choices of Healer, Necromancer, and Warrior.
