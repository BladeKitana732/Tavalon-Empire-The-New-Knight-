## Game instruction && rules for "RPG"
1. Must go through village to get to Castle and get knighted.
2. Must make choices that effect the journey outcomes.
3. Must make a choice within a timed manner; countdown varies dependent on situation; choice randomly picked if no selection is made from user ex) battle encounter choice timer set to 15seconds.
4. Must battle; each character has a special weapon that carries different endings if choice is made to find special weapon along journey (easter egg/NOT NEEDED not win game). (if extra time permits).
5. Game runs until in castle and knighted by Queen; solo mode will have user meet all other characters outside of character list to battle. 
6. IF 2 player mode is selected with user, have screen "split" where both sides make a choice within timer.
8. Game over when die in battle, or did not get knighted.
